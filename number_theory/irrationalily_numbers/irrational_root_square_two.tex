\title{Proof that the square root of 2 is Irrational}
\author{Ruben Colomina Citoler}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
This is a basic number theory result on the non-rationality of $\sqrt{2}$. To proof this  a \textit{Reductio ad Absurdum} can be applied. Thus, suppose $\sqrt{2} \in \mathds{Q} $ is true, and derive conclusions from this until we will finally arrive to get a contradiction. From this hypotheses we derive that, $\exists p,q \in \mathds{Z}$, such as $\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$ can be write such as an irreducible fraction. Thus, taking squares on the previous expression, we can write the following equation:
\begin{equation}
  p^2 = 2 q^2 
\label{first}  
\end{equation}
Before to continue, it is trivial to notice that if $2 | a^2 \Rightarrow 2 | a$, which is trivial because if $2 \nmid a$, then $2 \nmid a^2.$ (where $\nmid$ means "not divided by'').
Thus, from \eqref{first}, due to $p^2$ is pair (so $p$), $\exists k_1 \in \mathds{N}$, such as:
\begin{equation}
  p = 2k_1
  \label{second}
\end{equation}
Therefore, we can deduce:
\begin{equation}
  2 q^2 = (2k_1)^2 = 4{k_1}^2 \Rightarrow q^2 = 2 {k_1}^2 
  \label{third}
\end{equation}
From \eqref{second}, as before, due to $q^2$ is pair, $\exists k_2 \in \mathds{N}$, such as:  
\begin{equation}
  q = 2 k_2,
  \label{fourth}
\end{equation}
From equations \eqref{second} and \eqref{fourth}, we can rewrite $\sqrt{2}$ as a reducible fraction:
\begin{equation}
 \sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q} = \frac{2 k_1}{2 k_2} = \frac{k_1}{k_2} 
\end{equation}
Which is a contradiction $\lightning$ due to by hypothesis, $\frac{p}{q}$ is irreducibly.
\begin{equation*}
\therefore \sqrt{2} \in \mathds{I}
\end{equation*}
